    "## **Introduction/Motivation**\n",
    "\n",
    "This project is driven by the need to understand and analyze key trends in the online sales of electronics, home appliances, clothing, books, beauty products, and sports items. The goal is to address two core challenges: identifying top-selling products in each category and analyzing regional variations in their sales performance, and exploring customer purchasing patterns and payment preferences across regions. These insights are helpful for businesses aiming to optimize operations, marketing strategies, and customer experiences in a competitive market.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Research Questions \n",
    "\n",
    "1. `Which region generates the highest and lowest revenue?`\n",
    "2. `What is the most commonly used and least preferred payment method?`\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Data Collection**\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project was sourced from Kaggle and is titled \"Online Sales Dataset - Popular Marketplace Data\", uploaded by Shreyansh Verma, a data analyst intern at No Broker Hood in Bengaluru, Karnataka, India. The data appears to have been collected during his internship, likely reflecting real-world sales data from a popular marketplace.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although I did not collect the data myself, it was made available through Kaggle as part of Shreyansh Verma's professional work. The dataset includes detailed records of online sales, possibly gathered via web scraping, APIs, company partnerships, or public records during his role. It contains approximately 200 to 300 customer records over a specified timeframe, providing insights into customer transactions, product sales, and payment methods. \n",

The average number of units sold per transaction is 2.16, with a standard deviation of 1.32, indicating modest variation in purchase sizes. Unit prices vary widely, with a mean of $236.40 but a maximum of $3,899.99, highlighting the presence of high-value items. Similarly, total revenues range significantly, from as low as $6.50 to $3,899.99, reflecting substantial differences in transaction values based on the combination of units sold and item price. This data shows the potential for segmenting sales trends by product price range and revenue generation."

Companies could focus their marketing and inventory efforts on high-revenue regions while exploring under-performing areas.

Overall, the analysis highlights the importance of data-driven decision-making in identifying revenue patterns and customer behaviors, offering a foundation for strategic improvements in online retail."
